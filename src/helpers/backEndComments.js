// 01 - for more Organizing component and consistent file structure
/*
    I - i moved imgage on "/src/component/show/download.png" to the path
    "/src/assets/img"

    II - Also all css files should be in the path "/src/assets/css"

    II - Also i moved all the CRUD functions on App.jsx "createElement, delete, update"
    to another file named crudfunctions in "src/helpers/crudfunctions.js"
    and functions of "handleChange, seTemporary, ..." to the file helpersFunctions "src/helpers/helpersFunctions.js"
    Also to work properly i added constructor function to the App.jsx and bind `this` keyword to work correctly
    ? see App.jsx line 44

    III - Also install nice vscode extension named "Material Icon Theme" by Philipp and has 16,389,162 download
    its support various type of icon to display on the Explorer window in vscode
